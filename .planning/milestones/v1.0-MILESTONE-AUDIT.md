## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01-core-messages-parity | passed | Human verification completed |
| 02-token-counting-alignment | verified | TOK-01 evidence via Phase 6 harness |
| 03-privacy-first-observability | passed | Human verification completed |
| 04-streaming-+-tool-use-parity | passed | Human verification completed |
| 05-credential-error-envelope-parity | passed | Missing-credential envelope parity verified |
| 06-token-count-billing-alignment-verification | passed | Harness and report verified |

## Integration Check

- **Wiring gaps:** none
- **Orphaned exports:** none
- **Orphaned routes:** `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/stream` (expected public API)

## End-to-End Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST /v1/messages | complete | Mapping → transport → response normalization → error envelopes wired |
| POST /v1/messages/stream | complete | Streaming transport → translator → SSE output wired |
| POST /v1/messages/count_tokens | complete | Shared normalization → token counting utilities wired |
| Observability logging | complete | Redaction + correlation middleware + handler logging wired |
| Missing credential handling | complete | Auth error envelope for HTTP + SSE wired |
| Token-count verification harness | complete | Proxy vs OpenAI usage comparison wired |

## Tech Debt and Deferred Items

- None detected in verification reports.
